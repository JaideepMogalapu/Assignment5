# Description : 
This Project is about Clustering & Dimensionality reduction.We have various ICP used for achieving this.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the dimensions of a dataset while retaining most of its variation. 
we used the k-means algorithm on the reduced-dimensionality space to cluster the data points.
By using scaling, PCA, and k-means in a pipeline, we  simplified the code and improved the performance of clustering.
SVM:
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis
Scaling:
Scaling is a pre-processing step that is usually performed on data to normalize the range of values of each feature. This step ensures that each feature is treated equally by the machine learning algorithm. In this case, we used the StandardScaler from the scikit-learn library to perform scaling on the pd_speech_features.csv dataset.
